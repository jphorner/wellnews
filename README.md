# WellNews

## Abstract

A novel news application that seeks to help news consumers feel emotionally balanced after reading the news. This application was built utilizing TypeScript, React, React Hooks, and React Router.

Visit our <a href="https://najinl.github.io/wellnews/">deployed site</a>.

## Snapshot of Application

When the user visits the app, they will be asked to select an emoji representing their current generalized emotional affect: strongly negative, negative, neutral, positive, or strongly positive.

In the background, all of the articles’ titles and abstracts are processed by Dandelion’s Sentiment Analysis API and each given a sentiment score (from 0 (strongly negative) to 10 (strongly positive)). Based on the user's mood, they will see articles pulled from the NYT’s Top Stories API, sorted by sentiment.

The app keeps track of and updates the session’s affect score based on the affect of the articles that the user subsequently reads. The articles will be continually sorted and nudge the user toward sentimental balance. We don't filter the feed. If the user prefers not to indicate their mood, they can press 'skip' and the app will sort based only on the articles read.
